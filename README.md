# Neural networks
On this repository you can find some basical implementation of a neural network with an activation function such as sigmoid function.<br>
On the first step i tried to create just a neuron and see the output.<br>
On the last one it is a scretch of a basic convolutional neural network which recognize numbers between 0 and 9 from a dataset
